# Overview One Technology Demo
SpaceVR is the world’s first virtual reality platform allowing users to #BeAnAstronaut and experience space firsthand from any mobile, desktop or virtual reality device. Through the use of 360-degree cameras, SpaceVR technology capture footage from Low Earth Orbit back to Earth so consumers can experience space travel in immersive virtual reality. Only 536 people have ever viewed the Earth from space, leading to a unique experience that astronauts refer to as the Overview Effect – national boundaries disappear, conflicts seem unimportant and humans are united in a desire to protect this "pale blue dot" called home. SpaceVR aims to bring this experience to everyone in realizing its mission of bringing the world together to preserve our planet. SpaceVR will provide this content through a “space-as-a-service” subscription model, with packages designed for consumers, classrooms, game developers, museums and more. Additionally, SpaceVR is not stopping at the ISS – the company hopes to provide a wide range of space-related content from locations such as the moon by 2017, an asteroid by 2022 and Mars by 2026.

This ardunio code base was used to perform data logging on a Go Pro based VR camera technology demostration on a 100,000 feet high altitude balloon with Standford Space Initiative (SSI).
